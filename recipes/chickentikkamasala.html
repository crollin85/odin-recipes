    <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows)</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in small batches or 2 or 3, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)</li>
                <li>Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.</li>
                <li>Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.</li>
                <li>Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice and Naan bread!</li>
            </ol>
        <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leave out brown sugar for a less sweet finish.</li>
                <li>Use slightly less tomato sauce and a little more cream for a less sweet and lighter colored finish.</li>
                <li>Use a little more garam masala, cumin, tumeric, coriander, chili powder, and salt for a more savory instead of sweet finish.</li>
            </ul>
